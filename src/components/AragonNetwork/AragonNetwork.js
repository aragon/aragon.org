        Aragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized
        organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online
        decentralized court system that isnâ€™t bound by traditional artificial
        barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single
        country

        Aragon organizations can be upgraded seamlessly using our AragonOS
        architecture. They can solve disputes between two parties by using the
        decentralized court system, a digital jurisdiction that operates only
        online and utilizes your peers to resolve issues

        The Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the
        people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single
        aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an
        effort for a better future
